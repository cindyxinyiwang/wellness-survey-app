wellness-survey-app
===================

This is an iOS app that works with online database Parse.com. It is used to send out survey questions to users about their 
health conditions. Answers are sent back to Parse for further evaluation and analysis. Right now the app is under construction.
A login and sign up interface is added before the main list of questions. To log in the app, either put username:"sunny"
and password "123"(a username already registered and store in data base), or register with a new username.
